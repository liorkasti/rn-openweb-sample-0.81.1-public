# OpenWeb RN Sample 0.81.1

React Native 0.81.1 sample app for testing OpenWeb SDK integration. Supports both Old (Paper/Bridge) and New (Fabric/TurboModules) architectures.

## Purpose

This POC validates:

- Minimum RN version compatibility for OpenWeb SDK
- Old and New Architecture support
- yalc-based local SDK development workflow

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── screens/
│   └── HomeScreen.tsx          # Main screen with spotId/postId inputs
├── features/
│   └── conversation/
│       ├── components/
│       │   ├── PreConversation.tsx   # Comment count preview
│       │   └── Conversation.tsx      # Full conversation view
│       ├── services/
│       │   └── OpenWebConversation.ts # SDK service layer
│       └── types.ts
└── config/
```

## Setup with yalc

### 1. Install yalc globally

```bash
npm install -g yalc
```

### 2. Publish SDK locally (in SDK directory)

```bash
cd /path/to/openweb-react-native-sdk
yalc publish
```

### 3. Add SDK to this project

```bash
cd /Users/kst/OpenWeb/Side_Projects/OpenWebRnSample081
yalc add react-native-openweb-sdk
yarn install
```

### 4. Update SDK after changes

```bash
# In SDK directory
yalc push

# In this project
yarn update-sdk
```

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
